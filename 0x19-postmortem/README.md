# Postmortem Report: May 24, 2024 Outage
Issue Summary
## Duration:
Outage lasted from 11:30 AM to 2:45 PM UTC (3 hours 15 minutes).

## Impact:
The primary web application was down, affecting approximately 75% of users who experienced complete service unavailability. This included inability to access the website, perform transactions, and retrieve account information.

## Root Cause:
A misconfiguration in the load balancer caused an overwhelming traffic routing to a single server, leading to its crash and subsequent failure to serve user requests.

## Timeline
- 11:30 AM:
Issue detected via monitoring alert indicating high error rates on the main application.

- 11:35 AM:
Initial investigation began, assuming a potential database overload.

- 12:00 PM:
Database health checks showed normal operation; issue escalated to the network operations team.

- 12:20 PM:
Network team identified abnormal traffic patterns but initially suspected a potential DDoS attack.

- 12:45 PM:
Misleading investigation path focused on security breaches; additional firewall rules were temporarily applied without resolving the issue.

- 1:30 PM:
Reassessment of the issue led to the discovery of load balancer misconfiguration.

- 2:00 PM:
Configuration was corrected, redistributing traffic evenly across all servers.

- 2:45 PM:
Full service was restored, with monitoring confirming system stability.

## Root Cause and Resolution
### Root Cause:
The load balancer was incorrectly configured during a recent update, causing all incoming traffic to be routed to a single server instead of being distributed across multiple servers. This server became overwhelmed, crashed, and was unable to handle any further requests, leading to the service outage.

### Resolution:
The network operations team identified the configuration error and updated the load balancer settings to ensure proper traffic distribution. After the configuration was corrected, the affected server was restarted, and traffic was monitored to confirm the load was balanced correctly. The system returned to normal operation, and monitoring tools confirmed the stability and performance of the service.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures
### Improvements:
- Enhance monitoring to detect load imbalance issues earlier.
- Implement automated alerts specifically for load balancer configuration anomalies.
- Increase redundancy and failover capabilities for critical servers.

## Tasks:
### Patch Load Balancer Configuration:
- Review and update all load balancer configurations to prevent similar misconfigurations.
- Implement automated configuration checks during deployment.

### Improve Monitoring Systems:
- Add specific monitoring alerts for load balancer traffic patterns.
- Enhance logging to provide more detailed insights into traffic distribution and server load.

### Conduct Training and Drills:
- Train the network operations team on recognizing and addressing load balancer issues.
- Conduct regular disaster recovery drills simulating similar scenarios to improve response time.

### Review and Update Incident Response Plan:
- Include steps for validating load balancer configuration as part of the initial diagnostic process.
- Ensure clear communication channels and protocols for escalating incidents across teams.

By addressing these measures, we aim to prevent future occurrences of similar issues and improve our overall system reliability and response strategies.
